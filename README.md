### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I am a builder passionate about system design, developer experience, static typing, and functional programming. Educated in design theory, practice, and social responsibility, I fell into programming through the portal of open source, Node.js, and GitHub. Over a decade later after leading many projects and teams, I find myself working in the open source TypeScript and GraphQL communities. In my personal life, I sometimes work on open source projects, but closest to my heart are the backpacking trips I take my two boys on across the beautiful rugged Canadian wilderness! ðŸ—»ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦
